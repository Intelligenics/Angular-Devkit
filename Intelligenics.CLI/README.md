# Intelligenics Command Line Interface

This CLI is provided as part of the Angular developer kit and provides support for the Modular developer as part of Intelligenics development processes used to build angular based projects. 

The CLI supports several commands for productivity and CI/CD optimisation

To see a list of commands type the following

```
igx --help
``` 

# Available Commands 
## Updating Projects
To update all projects in the current solution run the command in the root solution folder. Alternatively to update a single module, run the command in the modules root folder

```            
igx update
```

## Project Management

These commands are used to support CI/CD process and should not be used in local environments.

This command calculates the changed module based on the commit information and returns the project path. The command errors if more no modules changes are found or more than one module is found to have been changed as the process relies on only one and exactly one module being changed per PR submission.

This command will run and check the last two commits applied
```
igx get-changed-module
```       

### Options
          
Gets the module that has been changed based on the branch information.

```
-b branchname branchname
```   
```
e.g   igx get-changed-module -b develop feature/test   // returns "mymodulepath"
```
Gets the module that has been changed based on the commit information   
```
-c commitno1 commitno2 command
```
```            
e.g   igx get-changed-module -c 934383434399ddfdc 83934738838ddfc8d // returns "mymodulepath"
``` 

### Package Copy
This command copies the dependency information from the root package.json into the deployed package.json. Angular's default is to provide a package.json in the library. This requires duplicated effort to maintain two seperate files. This command must be run from the folder container the module at its root. 
```
igx package-copy 
```

## Whitelisting
Whitelisting ensures 3rd party libraries dont leak into the projects without authorisation. By using a whitelist file in your CI/CD pipeline you can make sure only packages authorised by the company are allowed to be used. 

This command checks the package.json has references to packages that are allowed in the specified whitelist. The whitelist must a be simple JSON file with the following format. As long as the dev dependencies and dependencies inside the package.json exist in the whitelist file no errors will be reported. 

```
{
  "@angular/animations":"",
  "@angular/cdk":"",
  "@angular/common":"",
  "@angular/compiler":""
}
```
```
igx check-whitelist -whitelist-file='filepath'
```

## Project generation
The system supports project generation of portal, module and styles module artifacts. 


```
igx g solution --company=companyname --product=productname --module=modulename     
```
Generates a solution with styles a portal, and one module
```
igx g module   --company=companyname --product=productname --module=modulename     
```
Generates a feature module inside a solution folder.
```
igx g styles   --company=companyname --product=productname
```
Generates a styles module inside a solution folder
```            
igx g portal   --company=companyname --product=productname
```
Generates a portal inside a solution folder
